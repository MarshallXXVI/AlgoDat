Proof by contradiction.

Assumptions: 
(1) G has a unique light edge, call it (u,v) 
(2) W.l.o.G., there is a cut (S, V\S) in G. The edge (u,v) the maximally light (a.k.a. lightest) edge of the cut (S, V\S) in G.
 
Let then T be G's MST. 

Let T' be  a set containing (u,v).
Let (u,v) ∈ T'. 

Let T' be a set containing (u,v) (i.e. (u,v) ∈ T')


Since T spans G, T must have a unique path from any edge to any other edge.

Let P the set containing all edges in the path connecting S and V\S.

If (u,v) ∉ P, then w((u,v)) < w((x,y)) (for any (x,y) ∈ P). In this case, the spanning tree
(T \{(xi,yi)})∪{(u,v)}) would weight less than T. This contradicts the assumption that T is an MST. (i in x an y are subcripted)

Therefore (u,v) must be contained in T.  ☐


Version(2)

Proof by contradiction.

Let T and T’ be two minimum spanning trees which differ by at least one edge.

Let this edge be (u, v). Therefore, edge (u, v) is an element of T, but not an element of T’

Let (u, v) cross some arbitrary cut S and V\S in G.

Since (u, v) is not an element of T’, there exists another element of T’, mainly (x, y) which crosses some cut in G.

Now suppose either (u, v) or (x, y) is the light edge crossing the cut.

Assumption: Let (u, v) be the light edge.

Since (u, v) is not an element of T’, there exists some path in T’ from u to v. This path must cross the cut somewhere at (x, y).

Since (u, v) is a unique minimum edge, weight (x, y) > (u, v)

Therefore, cut (x, y) from T’ and add (u, v) to reduce the weight of the tree.

Therefore T’ was not the minimum spanning tree.
