Tree: 
	A tree is an acyclic and connected 
	graph

Path
	A path in a graph (V,E) is a sequence of vertices 〈v0,v1,...,vn〉, where (vj →vj+1)∈E for j=0,...,n−1.

Cycle: 
	If v0 = vn in a path, then the path is called a cycle. 

Acyclic:
	A graph is called acyclic if it contains no cycles.

 Connected:
 	A graph is connected if, for every pair u, v of vertices, there exists a path from u to v.

ST: 
	Of a Graph G, a spanning tree is (1) a minimal connected subgraph (i.e. removing any edge disconnects it) and (2) a maximal acyclic subgraph (i.e. adding any edge creates a cycle)


MST:
	minimum (weight) spanning tree (MST) problem is given an connected undirected graph G = (V, E), find a spanning tree of minimum weight (i.e. sum of the weights of the edges). That is, find a spanning tree T that minimizes w(T) = Sigma _subscript:e ∈ E(T)w_sub:e


Cut (edges): 
	A cut(S, V\S) of G = (V,E) is a partition of vertices of V.

Edge crossing a cut:
	An edge (u, v) ∈ E crosses the cut(S, V \ S) if one of its end point is in the set S and the other one in the set (V \ S).

Cut respecting A:
	A cut (S, V \ S) respects the set A if none of the edges of A crosses the cut.
Light edge:
	An edge which crosses the cut and which has the minimum cost of all such edges.
