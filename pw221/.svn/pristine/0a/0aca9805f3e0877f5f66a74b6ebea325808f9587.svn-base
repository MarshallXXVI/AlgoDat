# Task 1:

1.a'
Let G be an arbitrary connected graph with two minimum spanning trees (MST) T and T'. 

If G has two distinct MST, then G must have two edges which have the same weight. It must be proven that some pair of edges in G have the same weight.

T and T' must contain an edge that the other tree omits. 

Let e and e' be the least-weight edges in the two T/T' and T'/T respectively. Assume w(e) ≤ w(e')
Since e ∉ T′, the subgraph T' ∪ {e} contains exactly one cycle C passing through the edge e. 
Let e'' be any edge of this cycle that is not in T.
At least one such edge must exist, because T is a tree.  
Since e ∊ T, then e'' != e. Hence e'' ∊ T' \ T. It follows that w(e'') ≥ w(e') ≥ w(e).

Consider the spanning tree T'' = T' +  -e''. 
We have then w(T'') = w(T') + w(e) - w(e'') ≤  w(T'). 
T' is, however, a MST, so w(T'') = w(T'); in other words, T'' is also a MST. In conclusion, w(e) = w(e''). 

1.b
Assumptions: 
(1) G has a unique light edge, call it (u,v) 
(2) W.l.o.G., there is a cut (S, V\S) in G. The edge (u,v) the maximally light (a.k.a. lightest) edge of the cut (S, V\S) in G.
 
Let then T be G's MST. 

Let T' be  a set containing (u,v).
Let (u,v) ∈ T'. 

Let T' be a set containing (u,v) (i.e. (u,v) ∈ T')


Since T spans G, T must have a unique path from any edge to any other edge.

Let P the set containing all edges in the path connecting S and V\S.

If (u,v) ∉ P, then w((u,v)) < w((x,y)) (for any (x,y) ∈ P). In this case, the spanning tree
(T \{(xi,yi)})∪{(u,v)}) would weight less than T. This contradicts the assumption that T is an MST. (i in x an y are subcripted)

Therefore (u,v) must be contained in T.
